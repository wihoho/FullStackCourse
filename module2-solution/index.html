                spacing
                between sections (both horizontal and vertical). Note the horizontal spacing between the edges of the
                section and the edges of the browser window. Also, note the spacing between the dummy text in each
                section
                and the edges of the section. Lastly, make sure the dummy text is "pushed down" enough so it doesn't
                overlap
                the section title region. (Hint: use margins and padding and use border-box as your box-sizing as
                discussed
                in Lecture 19.)
